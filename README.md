# Age-Gender-detection

In this repository, we will be using CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) for age and gender predictions from a youtube video, you donâ€™t need to download the video just the video URL is fine. The interesting part will be the usage of CNN for age and gender predictions on video URLs.

You can read [this article](https://www.theaidream.com/post/predict-age-and-gender-using-convolutional-neural-network-and-opencv) to understand step by step of building Age Gender detection model.
